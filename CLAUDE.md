# ants-incremental

A browser-based ant colony incremental game. Hosted on GitHub Pages, played in a browser tab.

## Working style — read this first

**Do exactly what I asked. Nothing more.**

- One request = one change. If I ask for the egg counter, write the egg counter. Do not also add a settings menu, a dark mode toggle, an achievements panel, or a tooltip system.
- Do not "improve" or refactor code I did not ask you to touch. If you notice something worth changing, say so in one sentence and wait.
- Do not add features you think the game needs. Game design decisions are mine. If you have an idea, describe it in a sentence — do not implement it.
- Do not create new files without asking. Say which file you want to create and why, then wait.
- Do not add dependencies, libraries, CDN links, build tools, or config files without asking.
- Do not rewrite balance numbers, cost curves, or formulas unless I explicitly ask you to change balance.
- Do not add comments explaining what obvious code does.
- Do not write tests unless I ask.

**When a request is ambiguous, ask one short question instead of guessing and building something large.**

Prefer the smallest change that works. A twenty-line diff I can read beats a two-hundred-line rewrite that does the same thing.

## Hard constraints

These are not preferences. Breaking them breaks the deployment.

- `index.html` lives at the repository root. Never move it into `src/`, `public/`, `dist/`, or anywhere else. GitHub Pages serves the root.
- No build step. No bundler, no transpiler, no npm scripts required to run the game. I must be able to open `index.html` and have it work.
- No frameworks. Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only. No React, Vue, Svelte, jQuery, Tailwind, Bootstrap.
- No external CDN links, no fonts loaded from the network, no analytics. Everything ships from the repo.
- Plain `.js` files loaded with `<script type="module">`. No TypeScript.
- No server code. No backend. No API calls. The game is fully client-side and must work offline once loaded.

## File layout

```
index.html          entry point, root, do not move
style.css           all styling
js/game.js          state object, tick loop, save/load
js/ants.js          castes, production, costs
js/ui.js            DOM rendering and event handlers
CLAUDE.md           this file
README.md
```

Keep to this layout. If a file grows past roughly 400 lines, tell me and suggest a split — do not split it yourself.

---

## Code conventions

- Single global state object named `game`. All persistent values live inside it. No stray module-level mutable variables.
- One `tick(dt)` function drives all production. `dt` is seconds elapsed. Never assume a fixed frame rate.
- UI reads from `game` and renders. UI never mutates `game` directly — it calls functions in `game.js` or `ants.js`.
- Save with `localStorage` under the key `ants_save_v1`. Bump the version suffix when the save shape changes, and write a migration rather than silently wiping saves.
- Offline progress = elapsed wall-clock seconds since last save, capped, fed through the same `tick()`. Do not write a separate offline code path.
- Numbers: plain JavaScript numbers for now. When values exceed roughly `1e300`, tell me — we will discuss a big-number library then. Do not add one preemptively.
- Format displayed numbers through one shared `fmt()` function. Never format inline.
- Names in code match names in the game fiction: `reserves`, `eggs`, `nanitics`, `foragers`, `nurses`, `excavators`.

## Game design canon

This is settled. Do not redesign it. If you think something is wrong, say so in one sentence.

**Founding phase.** The game opens with a mated queen who has already landed. First click sheds her wings and grants a finite pool of `reserves` that never regenerates. Eggs cost reserves. When the first workers emerge, reserves become permanently irrelevant.

**Nanitics.** The first worker generation is undersized and weak. This is intentional and biologically accurate — it is not a balance bug.

**Castes differ in kind, not degree.** Never make a caste a strictly-better version of another one.

- Foragers — produce Food, the main currency
- Nurses — increase the egg-to-worker conversion rate
- Excavators — increase the colony population cap
- Soldiers — reduce losses from raid events

**Unlocks are gated by colony population, not by purchasing upgrades.** 25 ants unlocks Excavators, 100 unlocks Nurses, 400 unlocks Soldiers.

**Prestige is the nuptial flight.** Not built yet. Do not build it until I ask.

## The test loop

Every change ships to GitHub Pages at `https://theteiton.github.io/ants-incremental/`. Before saying a change is done, confirm the game still loads and the first sixty seconds still play. A change that breaks the opening is worse than no change.

## Summary

Small diffs. Ask before adding. Design decisions are mine.
